# VIH_Cellular_Automata
A cellular automata bases on a model found a document available at www.sciencedirect.com
The pdf is also available in this repository

I also add some screenshots to see the behavior of the automata

The entire project is made on ANSI-C because originally was made to get an extra point for "algoritmia y programacion estructurada" which is a subject from my first semester at university
